Description: utilscognigen facilitates creation, execution, and review of R files along with other utilities for an R/RStudio environment. Created/copied R files are designed to include headers that describe the intent of the program. Programs can be executed in batch mode directly from R according to CPP's production standards. Resulting log files can be parsed to identify warnings and errors.
